# Data Folder Procedure

For privacy purposes please keep data stored in this folder on your local machine. The data load R file will use the names from the original data distribution, and the .gitignore file will exclude these files specifically from github.

**If you add a raw data file with PII (Personal Identifiable Information) please add it to the .gitignore and distribute through a private channel.**
